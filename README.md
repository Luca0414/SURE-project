# Evolving Regression Models for Causal Testing

This repository contains the replication package for our paper entitled "[Evolving Regression Models for Causal Testing](#)".

## Pre-Requisites
We use [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com) to manage dependencies and virtual environments.
While this is not essential, we strongly recommend you use some kind of virtual environment.
Our Python version and dependencies can be found in `environment.yaml`.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a conda environment: `conda env create -f environment.yaml`. This will create en environment named `gplr` (Genetic Programming Linear Regression), although you can name the environment differently if you wish.
3. Activate the conda environment: `conda activate gplr`.
