# Causal Testing Framework Example Data
For convenience, this directory contains the data from the two relevant examples distributed with the [causal testing framework](https://github.com/CITCOM-project/CausalTestingFramework), renamed for readability.

`covasim_data.csv` comes from [here](https://github.com/AndrewC19/covasim_case_study/blob/65bc40ab7da88aece8e0127d56f8bdcb3701d150/data/observational_data.csv).

`poisson_data.csv` comes from [here](https://github.com/CITCOM-project/CausalTestingFramework/blob/main/examples/poisson/data.csv).

You can read more about this data, how it was generated, and how it was originally used in [this paper](http://doi.org/10.1145/3607184).
